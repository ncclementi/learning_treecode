Consider there are $n=100$ particles randomly scatterd in the domain $x$, $y$, $z$ $\\in$ $\\left[ 0, 1 \\right]$, each of them is a source and target. To contain all the particles, we define a **root** cubic cell centered at $(0.5,0.5, 0.5)$ with a side length of $1$. For a cubic cell, the radius is the half of side length, thus the root cell's radius $r_r$ is $0.5$. Then we choose $n_{crit}=10$ as the threshold to split a cell."

    "Since each non-empty cell is an instance which has some same properties (eg. cell's center coordinates, its parent, its children, its multipole, particles inside if it's a leaf), we first need to define a class for a cell, and we call this class \"Cell\". Every cell is an instance of **Class** \"**Cell**\", and all the instances are stored in a **list** called \"**cells**\". Therefore, the root cell is \"cells[0]\". For those who have not been exposed to object-oriented programming in python, check [this](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm) out as a quick guide.\n",
