Consider there are $n=100$ particles randomly scatterd in the domain $x$, $y$, $z$ $\\in$ $\\left[ 0, 1 \\right]$, each of them is a source and target. To contain all the particles, we define a **root** cubic cell centered at $(0.5,0.5, 0.5)$ with a side length of $1$. For a cubic cell, the radius is the half of side length, thus the root cell's radius $r_r$ is $0.5$. Then we choose $n_{crit}=10$ as the threshold to split a cell."
